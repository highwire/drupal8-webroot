    <h2 class="section-title">Common Maternal Complications Influencing Fetal Risk</h2>
    <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev2sec1" />
      <h3 class="section-title">Hypertensive Disorders</h3>
      <p id="d23795037e161">Hypertensive disorders are the most common obstetric complications in pregnancy worldwide, with an incidence of approximately
        10% (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>; <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo, Bentlin, &amp; Trindade, 2012</a>).
        These disorders are associated with adverse maternal outcomes and short- and long-term complications in the neonate.
        Hypertensive complications cover a broad spectrum of disorders, which are classified by the National High Blood Pressure
        Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy (<a href="#bid_1_11">Gifford et al., 2000</a>)
        into four categories: chronic hypertension (before or during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy), gestational hypertension
        (after 20 weeks of gestation without proteinuria), preeclampsia (hypertension developing after 20 weeks of gestation
        with proteinuria), and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension.</p>
      <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev3sec1" />
        <h4 class="section-title">Preeclampsia</h4>
        <p id="d23795037e175">Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder that is unique to pregnancy and can affect maternal brain, lungs, kidney,
          liver, coagulation cascade, and the fetus (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>). Severity of the
          disease varies with the gestational age at onset and presenting symptoms. Mild disease is generally associated
          with good outcomes. Severe disease, especially if the onset is early in gestation, is associated with eclampsia,
          cerebral hemorrhage, renal failure, hepatic failure,
          <abbrev>HELLP</abbrev> (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet) syndrome, prematurity, fetal growth restriction,
          oligohydramnios, placenta abruption, and intrauterine fetal demise (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>).
          Signs and symptoms associated with the diagnosis of preeclampsia include blood pressure (
          <abbrev>BP</abbrev>) of at least 160 mmHg systolic or at least 110 mmHg diastolic, new proteinuria of at least 2 grams
          protein in a 24-hour urine collection or + 2 to 3 on a urine dipstick, increased serum creatinine greater than
          1.2 mg/dL, platelet count lower than 100 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mcL, elevated hepatic enzymes, persistent headache or
          visual disturbances, and persistent epigastric pain (<a href="#bid_1_17">Lyell, 2004</a>).</p>
        <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev4sec1" />
          <h5 class="section-title">Pathophysiology</h5>
          <p id="d23795037e199">Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, there are several theories, including decreased placenta
            perfusion resulting from either abnormal implantation or abnormal placental vasculature (<a href="#bid_1_17">Lyell, 2004</a>;
            <a href="#bid_1_21">Moallem &amp; Koenig, 2009</a>). <a href="#bid_1_17">Lyell (2004)</a> proposed that the maternal
            immune response to foreign paternal antigens of the fetoplacental unit is a cause of preeclampsia. This is supported
            by the increased incidence of preeclampsia in multiparous women pregnant by a new partner. Angiotension II sensitivity
            is also more common in women with preeclampsia, which is a potent vasoconstrictor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev4sec2" />
          <h5 class="section-title">Risk Factors</h5>
          <p id="d23795037e213">Risk factors for preeclampsia include nulliparity, type 1 diabetes, chronic hypertension, multiple gestation, prior
            preeclampsia, eclampsia,
            <abbrev>HELLP</abbrev> syndrome, prepregnancy obesity, extremes of age, and assisted reproduction (<a href="#bid_1_17">Lyell, 2004</a>).
            Standard practice for the <span id="pg5" />diagnosis of preeclampsia is to obtain baseline studies, including
            a 24-hour urine collection, to quantify protein and
            <abbrev>BPs</abbrev> at each visit. The diagnosis of preeclampsia is made when there is a new
            <abbrev>BP</abbrev> elevation of greater than or equal to 140 mmHg systolic or greater than or equal to 90 mmHg diastolic
            twice after 20 weeks gestation and greater than or equal to 300 mg protein in a 24-hour urine collection (
            <a
              href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev4sec3" />
          <h5 class="section-title">Management</h5>
          <p id="d23795037e236">Management of preeclampsia usually involves delivery, close observation, and seizure prophylaxis with magnesium
            sulfate. The only known treatment is delivery of the infant. In this case, the interests of the mother and infant
            are in direct conflict. Exceptions to this would be if there were severe uteroplacental insufficiency or intrauterine
            growth restriction (
            <abbrev>IUGR</abbrev>; <a href="#bid_1_17">Lyell, 2004</a>). Timing of delivery is based on severity of disease. Criteria
            for immediate delivery are eclampsia, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, neurologic deficits, abruption, nonreassuring
            fetal testing, and persistent severely elevated
            <abbrev>BP</abbrev> despite treatment with two hypertensive regimens. If there are less severe symptoms, delaying delivery
            until a complete course of antenatal steroids can be given is recommended. Delivery at 34 weeks is advised with
            severe preeclampsia without any contraindications, at 37 weeks for preeclampsia without severe findings and chronic
            hypertension that is difficult to control with medication, at 37 to 38 weeks for gestational hypertension and
            chronic hypertension controlled with medication, and at 39 weeks for well-controlled hypertension with no medication
            required (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>).</p>
          <p id="d23795037e250">Magnesium sulfate administration for prophylaxis of maternal seizures may cause muscle relaxation by competing
            with calcium (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>; <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>).
            Magnesium crosses the placenta into fetal circulation and can cause neonatal respiratory depression requiring
            resuscitation. In addition, hypermagnesmia may decrease neonatal intestinal motility requiring slower-than-normal
            introduction of enteral feeding, especially in the preterm infant (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>;
            <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev4sec4" />
          <h5 class="section-title">Early Neonatal Outcomes</h5>
          <p id="d23795037e267">Chronic stress to the fetus may be associated with accelerated fetal pulmonary maturity caused by the increase
            in cortisol production in the fetus (<a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>). In this regard, preeclampsia
            may reduce the risk of respiratory distress, although there is controversy in the literature. Several large studies
            demonstrated that gestational age and preeclampsia were significant risk factors for respiratory distress syndrome
            (<a href="#bid_1_16">Langenveld et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>).</p>
          <p id="d23795037e278">Thrombocytopenia is a transient condition found in the first 72 hours after birth and usually resolves by day 10
            of life. It is thought to occur as a result of “decreased platelet production associated with fetal hypoxia,
            microangiopathic sequestration, and destruction in the placental thrombi” (<a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012, p. e534</a>).
            Infants with
            <abbrev>IUGR</abbrev> are at higher risk for thrombocytopenia (<a href="#bid_1_17">Lyell, 2004</a>; <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>).</p>
          <p
            id="d23795037e292">Neonatal neutropenia occurs in approximately 50% of infants born to hypertensive mothers (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>;
            <a href="#bid_1_21">Moallem &amp; Koenig, 2009</a>; <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>). Preeclampsia
            and neonatal neutropenia can be divided into two groups based on duration (<a href="#bid_1_21">Moallem &amp; Koenig, 2009</a>).
            The most common form usually resolves within the first 3 days of life and the more severe form may last up to
            1 month (<a href="#bid_1_21">Moallem &amp; Koenig, 2009</a>). Increased duration and severity of neutropenia
            was associated with very-low-birth-weight infants and small-for-gestational-age infants secondary to placental
            inhibitors (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>; <a href="#bid_1_21">Moallem &amp; Koenig, 2009</a>;
            <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>). Necrotizing enterocolitis (
            <abbrev>NEC</abbrev>) has been shown to occur in preterm infants with intrauterine distress and absent or reversed end-diastolic
            umbilical artery Doppler flow studies. As a result, preeclampsia should be considered a risk factor for
            <abbrev>NEC</abbrev>. Enteral feeds should be introduced cautiously in these infants. There <span id="pg6" />is also
            an association with increased feeding problems such as gastric residuals, regurgitation, and gastroesophageal
            reflux (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>; <a href="#bid_1_21">Moallem &amp; Koenig, 2009</a>;
            <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>). Close monitoring is required to identify feeding problems early.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev4sec5" />
          <h5 class="section-title">Late Outcomes</h5>
          <p id="d23795037e340">It has been hypothesized that abnormal intrauterine environments may have long-term effects in adult life. The
            theory suggests that diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, originate in utero from insults during
            critical periods of growth and development (<a href="#bid_1_20">McDonnold &amp; Olson, 2013</a>; <a href="#bid_1_28">Rugolo et al., 2012</a>).
            There is a growing body of evidence that supports children born to preeclamptic mothers have higher systolic
            and diastolic
            <abbrev>BPs</abbrev> and higher levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and plasma epinephrine. A population-based
            study with more than a million children showed an increased risk of endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic derangements
            in adolescence and early adulthood among the cohort exposed to preeclampsia in utero (<a href="#bid_1_30">Wu et al., 2009</a>).</p>

              <p id="d23795037e360">A 15-year-old gravida 1, para 0 (G1P0), Hispanic female presents to the labor and delivery (L&amp;D) unit at

                weeks of gestation and has had an uneventful pregnancy until 2 weeks ago when she began having severe headaches,
                increased weight gain, and pedal edema. Her vital signs on admission are stable with the exception of

  <h3 class="section-title">Placental Abruption and Placenta Previa</h3>
  <p id="d23795037e462"><span class="italic">Placental abruption</span> is defined as premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall
    prior to delivery; <span class="italic">placenta previa</span> is defined as a placenta located at or near the internal
    os. Both of these are serious complications that are responsible for up to one fourth of all perinatal deaths caused
    by third trimester bleeding (<a href="#bid_1_19">Matsuda et al., 2011</a>).</p>
  <div class="section"><span id="ch01lev3sec2" />
    <h4 class="section-title">Placental Abruption</h4>
    <p id="d23795037e475">The classic symptoms of placental abruption are bleeding and pain, but the clinical picture can vary from asymptomatic
      to massive bleeding leading to fetal death and severe maternal morbidity (<a href="#bid_1_29">Tikkanen, 2010</a>).
      When the placenta separates from the uterus, hemorrhage into the decidua basalis occurs. Vaginal bleeding usually follows
      but can be hidden if it occurs behind the placenta. As a hematoma forms, this further separates the placenta from the
      uterine wall and can compromise the blood supply to the fetus (<a href="#bid_1_29">Tikkanen, 2010</a>). Placental abruptions
      organized into four classes from 0 to 3. Class 0 is asymptomatic. Class 1 is mild and represents approximately 48%
      of all cases. There is no vaginal bleeding, slightly tender uterus, normal
      <abbrev>BP</abbrev> and heart rate (
      <abbrev>HR</abbrev>). There is no evidence of coagulopathy or fetal distress. Class 2 is moderate and represents approximately
      27% of all cases. There is no vaginal bleeding to moderate vaginal bleeding, moderate to severe uterine tenderness

      id="d23795037e499">Although the primary cause of placental abruption is generally unknown, many risk factors have been identified. These

    <h4 class="section-title">Placenta Previa</h4>
    <p id="d23795037e536">Placenta previa is fairly common within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. In most cases, it resolves leaving approximately
      10% that persist into later pregnancy. As the uterus grows, the placenta moves higher in the uterus. If this upward
      movement does not occur, then the risk of bleeding increases. The incidence of placenta previa is about one in 200
      pregnancies. There are three types of placenta previa: a marginal placenta previa (low lying placenta) that is near
      the cervical os, which usually moves up during pregnancy; a partial placenta previa that covers part of the cervical
      os; and a complete placenta previa that blocks the cervical opening (<a href="#bid_1_15">Johnston, Paterson-Brown, &amp; Paterson-Brown, 2011</a>;
      <a href="#bid_1_19">Matsuda et al., 2011</a>).</p>
    <p id="d23795037e544">The cause of placenta previa is unknown but several risk factors have been identified. It is more common in women with
      an abnormally shaped uterus, with advanced maternal age, smoking, multiple births, previous cesarean sections (C-sections),
      or prior uterine surgery. If there is bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation, placenta previa should be suspected and
      confirmed with ultrasound imaging. This scan should be repeated at 32 weeks of gestation to assess the placenta position
      and plan for third trimester management. In the majority of cases, if the placenta remains low or is anteriorly placed
      at 32 weeks, it is unlikely that the placenta will migrate up in the uterus.</p>
    <p id="d23795037e546">Mothers with a total placenta previa who have had previous bleeding should be admitted to the hospital from approximately
      34 weeks of gestation to delivery. Those with partial placenta previa who are asymptomatic may be managed as outpatients.
      If this is the case, it is important to have an emergency plan. This includes having someone available to assist if
      the need arises and have ready access to the hospital. In preparing for delivery, it is critical to have discussed
      the plan of care with parents, including the possible need for blood transfusions and hysterectomy. A C-section may
      be recommended if the placental edge is less than 2 cm from the internal os in the third trimester.</p>

  <h3 class="section-title"><span id="pg10" />Maternal Diabetes</h3>
  <p id="d23795037e735">Maternal diabetes can cause multiple problems for the neonate. Early in gestation, the high maternal glucose levels are
    passed on through the placenta to the infant and can cause congenital anomalies. Glucose molecules cross the placenta,
    but the large molecules of insulin do not. About midgestation, the fetal pancreas begins to produce large amounts of
    insulin and fetal islet cells develop compensatory hyperplasia, resulting in fetal hyperinsulinemia (see <a href="#fig1_1">Figure 1.1</a>).</p>
  <p
    id="d23795037e740">The most common problem that occurs in the
    <abbrev>IDM</abbrev> is an increase in the size or growth of the infant, in which the infant becomes large for gestational age
    (
    <abbrev>LGA</abbrev>). <span class="italic"><abbrev>LGA</abbrev></span> is defined as greater than the 90th percentile for weight,
    and is considered a larger-than-normal infant. This often occurs more in the second and third trimesters with increases
    in fat and glycogen storage (<a href="#bid_1_23">Potter, 2013</a>). Pregnancies with
    <abbrev>LGA</abbrev> infants lead to increased need for C-section and the risk of birth injuries. Prior to birth, it is important
    to assess pulmonary maturity because surfactant production appears to occur late in the fetal lungs of diabetic pregnancies,
    which can result in respiratory distress syndrome even at term gestation (<a href="#bid_1_24">Ramon &amp; Moore, 2012</a>).</p>
    <p
      id="d23795037e762">Structural abnormalities can occur in infants whose mothers have poor glucose control during the period of rapid growth
      and development (3–8 weeks of gestation). Therefore, the infant born to a diabetic mother must be assessed for structural
      defects in the delivery room. These defects can include congenital heart defects (murmur), renal defects/renal vein
      thrombosis (observe for voiding and palpation size of kidneys), caudal/sacral agenesis (observation), neural tube defects
      (visualize infant’s back), small left colon syndrome/meconium plug (failure to pass meconium in 24 hours and signs
      of obstruction), and skeletal dysplasia/hemivertebrae (observation/chest x-ray [
      <abbrev>CXR</abbrev>]). Episodes of maternal hyperglycemia promote fetal catabolism and hypoxia, which can cause the cardiac
      septal hypertrophy (cardiomyopathy), higher levels of erythropoietin with polycythemia, and possible sudden death in
      utero (<a href="#bid_1_24">Ramon &amp; Moore, 2012</a>).</p>

      <p id="d23795037e786"><span id="pg11" />After birth, hyperbilirubinemia and hyperviscosity can occur as a result of the polycythemia. Also,
        hypoglycemia occurs with the maternal glucose supply cutoff at the same time continued high levels of insulin are
        being produced by the neonate.</p>
      <p id="d23795037e789">Neonates with hypocalcemia can develop neurologic symptoms such as being jittery, or lethargy, apnea or tachypnea,
        hypotonia, cyanosis, or seizures. Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can occur in the
        <abbrev>IDM</abbrev> because of a delayed parathyroid gland response after birth (<a href="#bid_1_27">Rubarth, 2013</a>).
        Some of these same symptoms can occur as a result of low calcium and low magnesium levels.</p>
      <p id="d23795037e797">Maternal diabetes that is well controlled will have minimal symptoms and less risk for defects. There is a higher risk
        of congenital anomalies if glucose control is poor during the first trimester, but poor control later in pregnancy
        (as with gestational diabetes) can result in large infants with hypoglycemia. Maintenance of stable glucose levels
        is important in the insulin-dependent diabetic mother and the pregnant mother with gestational diabetes.</p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Neonatal Sepsis</h3>
  <p id="d23795037e996">Neonatal sepsis is a generalized bacterial or viral infection that occurs in neonates via many different routes. Infants
    are protected from bacterial infections in utero by the amniotic membranes and certain antibacterial factors present
    in the amniotic fluid. But some infants become infected in utero: (1) via the maternal bloodstream, (2) by ascending
    bacteria that either colonize or infect the mother’s birth canal, (3) by these same bacteria as the infant descends through
    the birth canal at delivery, or (4) via nosocomial infection within the
    <abbrev>NICU</abbrev> environment. Infants can become infected through use of scalp electrodes to monitor fetal heart tones.
    The majority of bacterial infections occur by the ascending route with either ruptured or intact membranes leading to
    premature birth (<a href="#bid_1_26">Rubarth, 2011</a>).
    <abbrev>PROM</abbrev> of greater than 24 hours can result in an increase in bacteria reaching the infant in utero (<a href="#bid_1_1">Anderson-Berry, Bellig, &amp; Ohning, 2014</a>).
    These bacterial infections can cause amnionitis and/or chorioamnionitis. The incidence of bacterial infections has declined
    as a result of administration of prophylactic antibiotics to pregnant women during labor and delivery.</p>

    <abbrev>CMV</abbrev>], herpes simplex virus [

    <abbrev>NICU</abbrev> (e.g., pseudomonas, coagulase-negative staphylococcus; <a href="#bid_1_1">Anderson-Berry et al., 2014</a>).</p>
  <p
    id="d23795037e1164">There are wide-ranging clinical manifestations of neonatal sepsis and no single set of criteria is reliable for diagnosing
    sepsis. Often the clinician states the infant “is not doing well” as a nonspecific sign of sepsis. Some of the signs
    can be subtle color changes or feeding difficulties. Temperature instability, increase in apnea, abdominal distension,
    and worsening respiratory distress are often early signs of neonatal sepsis. These signs can also be signs of other premature
    diagnoses such as respiratory distress syndrome, apnea of prematurity, feeding intolerance, and hypothermia. Many infants
    have feeding difficulties, but a combination of signs must lead the clinician to explore the possibility of sepsis. Signs
    of bloodstream infection lead to lethargy/hypotonia, mottling, cyanosis, pallor, hypotension, and shock. Meningitis occurs
    more frequently in late-onset infections, but signs of irritability or hypertonia must lead the clinician to do a lumbar
    puncture and send cerebral spinal fluid (
    <abbrev>CSF</abbrev>) for culture and sensitivities, Gram stain, glucose, protein, and cell count with differential. A
    <abbrev>CBC</abbrev> with differential, blood culture, urine bacterial antigen screen,
    <abbrev>CSF</abbrev> bacterial antigen screen, specific polymerase chain reaction (
    <abbrev>PCR</abbrev>) levels, and C-reactive protein (
    <abbrev>CRP</abbrev>) are well-accepted tests for neonatal sepsis (see <a href="#tab1_1">Table 1.1</a> for types and functions
    of
    <abbrev>WBCs</abbrev> and <a href="#tab1_2">Table 1.2</a> for measures of I:T ratio and total neutrophil count [
    <abbrev>TNC</abbrev>]).</p>
    <p id="d23795037e1194">Depending on the sensitivities of the blood cultures, treatment for bacterial sepsis always involves antibiotics. Treatment
      for viral infections can start with antivirals and can involve many variations of treatments, including antiretrovirals
      and protease inhibitors for human immunodeficiency virus (
      <abbrev>HIV</abbrev>), immunoglobulins specific for the virus (as with
      <abbrev>CMV</abbrev>), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (

        <p id="d23795037e1273">A mother was admitted to the labor and delivery (L&amp;D) unit of a local, community hospital. The mother was at
          36 6/7 weeks of gestation and was noted to be in active labor with ruptured membranes. She was A+ blood type, with
          negative antibody screen, rubella immune, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (

          <abbrev>GBS</abbrev>) was unknown. Because the mother was so close to 37 weeks and actively progressing, the attending
          obstetrician decided not start prophylactic antibiotics, but a
          <abbrev>GBS</abbrev> culture was sent. The mother delivered a 2,600-g infant about 5 hours after admission. The baby had
          a spontaneous cry and respirations, and appeared well with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.
          The infant stayed with the mother after the delivery with mother–baby care done by the couplet care nursing staff.</p>
        <p
          id="d23795037e1287">At about 12 hours of age, the mother called the nurse stating that the father was holding the infant and the baby
          appeared to be struggling and was making some grunting noises. The nurse enters the dimly lit room, turns on the
          overhead light, and sees that the baby is blue, pale, and grunting significantly. The baby is immediately brought
          to the Level II neonatal intensive care unit (

  <p id="d23795037e1628">
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev> is a multisystem, autoimmune, connective tissue disorder that can affect almost all organ systems, including
    the joints, skin, heart, lungs, nervous system, and kidneys (<a href="#bid_1_5">Classen, Paulson, &amp; Zacharias, 1998</a>;
    <a href="#bid_1_18">Madazli, Yuksel, Oncul, Imamoglu, &amp; Yilmaz, 2014</a>).
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev> mainly affects women in their childbearing years and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity
    and mortality. Mothers with
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev> have an increased risk of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, death, preeclampsia, preterm birth, congenital
    heart block, and neonatal lupus erythematous (
    <abbrev>NLE</abbrev>; <a href="#bid_1_5">Classen et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bid_1_18">Madazli et al., 2014</a>). The risk of
    acerbation of
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev> during pregnancy is associated with the disease activity in the previous 6 to 12 months prior to pregnancy,
    so pregnancy should be planned during remission (<a href="#bid_1_18">Madazli et al., 2014</a>). The American Rheumatism
    Association has established criteria for the diagnosis of
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev>. If you have four of the following symptoms, and are a woman in your childbearing years, the following diagnoses
    can be made:

  <p id="d23795037e1697">Maternal treatments for flare-ups during pregnancy are anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, immunosuppressive, and anticoagulation
    drugs. Corticosteroids are also used to prevent flare-ups. Prednisone crosses the placenta and is therefore the drug
    of choice (<a href="#bid_1_3">Borchers, Naguwa, Keen, &amp; Gershwin, 2010</a>).</p>
  <p id="d23795037e1702">
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev> patients frequently have the anti-Sjögren’s-syndrome-related antigen A (
    <abbrev>SSA</abbrev>)/anti-Sjögren’s syndrome type B (
    <abbrev>SSB</abbrev>) antibodies, which are associated with an increased risk of
    <abbrev>NLE</abbrev> that can result from transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies causing fetal tissue damage and clinical
    symptoms of
    <abbrev>NLE</abbrev> (<a href="#bid_1_3">Borchers et al., 2010</a>). This condition is rare, affects females more than males,
    and involves multiple organs. Infants with
    <abbrev>NLE</abbrev> may display cutaneous rashes and are at significant risk for heart block. The skin manifestations are typically
    found on the head, scalp, and chest. These skin lesions appear as erythematous flat patches that change to large scaly
    plaques. The skin lesions develop within the first few weeks after birth up to 1 month and usually resolve by 6 months
    of age, which correlates with the disappearance of maternal antibodies. Hydrocortisone cream may be helpful (<a href="#bid_1_2">Boh, 2004</a>;
    <a href="#bid_1_5">Classen et al., 1998</a>).</p>
  <p id="d23795037e1731">Cardiac involvement, including cardiac arrhythmias and conduction defects, is common in infants with
    <abbrev>NLE</abbrev> with an incidence of 65% (<a href="#bid_1_8">Femia, Callen, &amp; Vleugels, 2014</a>). The <span id="pg18"
    />occurrence of congenital complete heart block occurs in approximately 15% to 30% of infants with
    <abbrev>NLE</abbrev>. Monitoring a fetal
    <abbrev>HR</abbrev> between 18 and 24 weeks of gestation will detect a large number of infants with heart block. Anti-SSA/Ro
    and anti-SSB-La antibodies bind to fetal cardiocytes and inhibit normal physiologic removal of apoptotic cells that result
    in an inflammatory reaction, which can lead to fibrosis of the cardiac conduction system (<a href="#bid_1_31">Yildirim, Tunaodlu, &amp; Karaabac, 2013</a>).
    Additionally, cross-reactivity of the
    <abbrev>SSA</abbrev>/
    <abbrev>SSB</abbrev> antibodies and downregulation of calcium channels may explain the cardiac rhythm disturbances that lead
    to decreased cardiac output and heart failure. These processes have the ability to cause myocarditis, hemorrhage, fibrosis,
    calcification, and necrosis in the conduction system, which leads to the development of various degrees of heart block
    (<a href="#bid_1_31">Yildirim et al., 2013</a>). Morbidity and mortality depend on the degree of heart block and other
    organ systems involved. Some infants may require a pacemaker.</p>
  <p id="d23795037e1760">Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia may be present at birth but these are transient. In addition, hepatomegaly occurs
    in 20% to 40% of patients and includes histologic changes such as cholestasis, fibrosis, and hepatitis (<a href="#bid_1_2">Boh, 2004</a>).
    In many cases, hepatic symptoms are self-limiting though severe liver failure is possible (<a href="#bid_1_8">Femia et al., 2014</a>).</p>

    <abbrev>NICUs</abbrev> (<a href="#bid_1_9">Fletcher &amp; Zach, 2015</a>). There have been increased numbers of multiple births
    in the past few decades as a result of more widespread use of assisted reproductive technologies (
    <abbrev>ART</abbrev>) and women postponing pregnancy until their 30s or later. Women in the age group of 35 to 40 years have
    higher rates of multiple ovulation and, therefore, dizygotic (fraternal) twins. This is thought to occur because of higher
    levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (
    <abbrev>FSH</abbrev>) in older women (<a href="#bid_1_9">Fletcher &amp; Zach, 2015</a>). Women with higher parity also have higher
    rates of dizygotic twinning. The rate of dizygotic twinning is highest in the Black race, followed by Caucasian and Hispanic
    races, and lowest in the Asian race. There is also a familial tendency for dizygotic (fraternal) twins through the mother’s
    lineage, and a probable genetic link for monozygotic (identical) twins (<a href="#bid_1_10">Genetics &amp; Human Traits, 2016</a>).</p>
  <p
    id="d23795037e1935">Understanding the terminology and pathophysiology of twinning is necessary to understand complications that can occur with
    multiple gestation pregnancies. With dizygotic twins, there are two eggs and two sperm. Each developing embryo has its
    own inner amniotic sac (amnion), outer amniotic sac (chorion), and placenta. Sometimes the two placentas can fuse and
    appear as one large placenta, but are easily separated after birth. These dizygotic twins are also called <span class="italic">fraternal twins</span>.</p>
    <p
      id="d23795037e1940">With monozygotic twins, there is one, single, fertilized egg that splits. Monozygotic twins have the same exact genotype,
      but can have minor differences in phenotype. These twins are also called <span class="italic">identical twins</span>.
      There are three different choices of placentation with monozygotic twins. If the embryo splits early within the first
      2 days after fertilization, then each fetal twin will develop its own amnion, chorion, and placenta prior to implantation,
      exactly the same as dizygotic twins (dichorionic/diamniotic, or “di–di”). If the embryo splits between day 3 and day
      8 after fertilization, then the twins will develop two amnions (inner sacs) with one chorion (outer sac) with one placenta
      (monochorionic/diamniotic, or “mono–di”). If the embryo <span id="pg20" />splits between 9 and 12 days after fertilization,
      the twins will be together in one sac (monochorionic/monoamniotic, or “mono–mono”) with one placenta. If the embryo
      splits later than 13 days after fertilization, the twins will be conjoined (<a href="#bid_1_9">Fletcher &amp; Zach, 2015</a>).</p>
      <p
        id="d23795037e1950">With triplets, there can be three separate zygotes, two zygotes in which one splits into two, or one zygote that splits
        into three identical zygotes. With higher order multiples, most embryos occur as a result of
        <abbrev>ART</abbrev> and are individual zygotes, each with a separate egg and sperm. Occasionally, a zygote can split, producing
        an identical pair of “twins” within the multiple set.</p>
        <p id="d23795037e1955">There are always an increased number of complications when both twins are within the same sac (monochorionic/monoamniotic).
          This is a relatively uncommon type of twin pregnancy and only occurs in about 1% of monozygotic twin pregnancies
          (<a href="#bid_1_9">Zach &amp; Fletcher, 2015</a>). With both infants within the same sac, there can be problems
          with cord entanglement, congenital anomalies, and other types of interactions that can compromise the two infants.
          Monochorionic twins with only one placenta also have an increased risk of
          <abbrev>TTTS</abbrev>. The two circulations can be intermixed with vascular connections between the two infants. These
          vascular connections can result in one twin shunting part of its blood flow to the second twin. The twin who receives
          the blood transfusion is called the “recipient” twin and is usually the larger twin. The recipient also appears
          plethoric as a result of the hypovolemia and polycythemia. The infant can exhibit hypertension with signs of congestive
          heart failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly (hydrops). This twin also usually presents with polyhydramnios.
          The “donor” twin is usually small and pale with hypovolemia and hypotension. As a result of shunting blood to its
          twin, the donor is anemic and thrombocytopenic. Hypoxia from the anemia can also lead to heart failure and hydrops
          fetalis. This twin usually presents with oligohydramnios, so the donor twin can appear to be “stuck” against the
          side of the uterine cavity because of lack of fluid.</p>
        <p id="d23795037e1963">Chronic
          <abbrev>TTTS</abbrev> usually occurs early in pregnancy, often with loss of one twin if not treated. Acute
          <abbrev>TTTS</abbrev> can occur any time during pregnancy with a more sudden occurrence. Arterial-to-venous connections
          are the most serious because of the difference in
          <abbrev>BPs</abbrev> between the two systems. These transfusions occur mostly in monochorionic pregnancies (either diamnionic
          or monoamnionic); therefore, only in identical twin pregnancies with one outer, chorionic membrane and one placenta.
          <abbrev>TTTS</abbrev> is rare in fused dichorionic placentas (<a href="#bid_1_25">Revenis, 2016</a>).</p>
        <p id="d23795037e1980">Another type of transfusion occurs in these infants as a complication with
          <abbrev>TTTS</abbrev>. It is called <span class="italic">twin reversed arterial perfusion</span> (
          <abbrev>TRAP</abbrev>), in which blood from the recipient twin suddenly reverses back to the donor twin because of hypotension
          of the donor twin (from acardia, a cardiac defect, or death of the donor twin). Often, both twins do not survive
          (<a href="#bid_1_25">Revenis, 2016</a>).
          <abbrev>TRAP</abbrev> results in blood going backward from the umbilical artery to the twins and then back to the placenta
          through the umbilical vein; this is the opposite of normal circulation (<a href="#bid_1_14">Johnson, Khalek, Martinez-Poyer, &amp; Moldenhauer, 2014</a>).</p>

                to the labor and delivery (L&amp;D) unit with a twin pregnancy with polyhydramnios noted on ultrasound. The
                twins are noted to have diamniotic/monochorionic (di–mono) placentation. Twin A is estimated to be approximately
                1,900 g and twin B is estimated to be 1,450 g with intrauterine growth restriction (

  <h2 class="section-title">Conclusions</h2>
  <p id="d23795037e2209">Maternal status and disorders affect the fetus and neonate because their body systems coexist together for up to 9 months.
    The woman’s body size and health status can cause disorders in the newborn. The woman’s previous health status prior
    to pregnancy can affect the future pregnancy. Disorders, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes,
    <abbrev>SLE</abbrev>, or other similar conditions, can have fetal or neonatal effects. Also, maternal problems can develop because
    of the pregnancy, like an abruption or placenta previa, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, premature labor,
    <abbrev>PROM</abbrev>, or infection. Bacterial or viral infections can occur because of problems with the pregnancy (e.g.,
    <abbrev>PROM</abbrev>) or exposure during the pregnancy. Lastly, the specific type of pregnancy (as in multiple gestation) can
    significantly affect both the mother and the fetus(es). Understanding these maternal complications and their effects
    on the newborn is imperative for the neonatal caretakers.</p>
