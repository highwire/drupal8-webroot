INTRODUCTION
------------

The Crazy Egg Integration module provides integration with the Crazy Egg
heatmap service.

In addition to heatmaps, this module enables other features including:
 * Scrollmaps so you can see where people are scrolling
 * Session recordings that allow you to watch recordings of your visitors
   interacting with your website.
 * A/B tests so you can set up split tests quickly. An integration with Crazy
   Egg is useful for on-page analytics and split testing.
